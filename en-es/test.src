as shown by the ex-post assessment of the directive , the scope for measures on prevention and reuse in isolation from the packaged product is relatively limited . any measure that is effective on prevention or reuse will also have impacts on packaged goods and their production , distribution and consumption patterns as well as on trade within the internal market . the studies used for the preparation of this report do not show a clear preference for one of the options to encourage prevention and reuse of packaging .
( 34 ) If it were appropriate to base the assessment directly on Article 87 ( 3 ) ( c ) , the Commission would draw a parallel to points 36 and 37 of the environmental aid guidelines to calculate the eligible cost . in accordance with these points , eligible cost must be confined to the extra investment costs necessary to meet the environmental objectives .

( 2006 / C 11 / 05 )
the risks to the budgetary projections in the programme appear broadly balanced . in particular , on the one hand , the fiscal target of a general government deficit of 5.2 % in 2004 seems within reach , on the other , concerning 2005 and beyond , the prudent underlying macro-economic scenario and the nature of the announced measures aiming at reducing the deficit , as well as budgetary projections set up in the programme make the consolidation path broadly pl@@ au@@ sible within the currently projected external environment .
